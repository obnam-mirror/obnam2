# NEWS for Obnam2, the backup software

This file summarizes changes between releases of the second generation
of Obnam, the backup software. The software is technically called
"obnam2" to distinguish it from the first generation of Obnam, which
ended in 2017 with version number 1.22.


## Obnam2 version 0.2.2, released 2021-01-29

This is the first release of Obnam2. It can just barely make and
restore backups. It's ready for a light trial, but not for real use.
There's no encryption, and backups can't be deleted yet. Restores of
the entire backup work.
