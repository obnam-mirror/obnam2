# Big decisions made by the Obnam project

This is a decision log of big decisions, often architectural ones, or
otherwise decisions that impact the project as a whole. They may be
decisions about non-technical aspects of the project.

Decisions should be discussed before being made so that there is a
strong consensus for them. Decisions can be changed or overturned if
they turn out to no longer be good. Overturning is itself a decision.

Each decision should have its own heading. Newest decision should come
first. Updated or overturned decisions should have their section
updated to note their status, without moving them.
